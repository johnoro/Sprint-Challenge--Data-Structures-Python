Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

constant, O(c), or, if you'd rather, O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

constant, O(c), or O(1)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

Based on the size of the new list, `k`:
linear, O(k)

4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

linear, O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

quadratic, O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

linear, O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

MVP: linear, O(n)
Stretch: loglinear, O(n*log(n))

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

linear, O(n), for both solutions.
